A new programming language. Initial plans are to develop this as a means of learning more about language concepts
while exploring new ideas.

Goal is a strongly typed language with a focus on developer safety (avoiding "gotchas" that cause unexpected
bugs). Syntax is such that it falls under the C-family, but draws inspiration from Java and Python. Advanced
features are still pending as the language's fundamentals evolve.
